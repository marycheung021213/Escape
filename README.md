# Escape
**First-Person VR Game Development**

Escape narrates the journey of the protagonist as he confronts his inner fears and, ultimately, finds reconciliation with himself. We conducted a series of experiments with various technologies to craft a non-Euclidean world within this game. Escape is built using Unity, and VR is supported by PICO 4.

Here is the repository for the source code.
